# steps boi

steps boi is a discord bot to sum the count of steps made by a community in a discord channel by reacting with a 👍 thumbs up to a message in the form:

```
!steps 12234
```

The bot will print out a progress bar as the steps are collected.

Stars are collected when someone submits steps above a certain threshold such as 5000 steps.
The step count and stars count are stored in the `challenge-data.json` file.
It has been programmed to only respond to one person in one channel using the user and channel IDs.
